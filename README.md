# Code in the Dark Event

Want to host a local html/css blind coding challenge where you can't visually check your results?  Here's how to do it.

Have each participant:
1. Clone this repo
2. Disable internet connection
2. Wait for everyone to have the repo cloned
3. Set a timer (i.e on your phone) for 15 minutes
4. Open index.html in their browser
5. Click the instructions button on the bottom right
6. Start coding
7. Stop after timer runs out
8. Click the download button on the bottom right
9. Save the design.html file in the same location as the repo, next to index.html
10. Open design.html in your browser and see/share your results
